      "description": "I'm Kawika Miller - Digital artist turned software developer with a background in game design and development. I started off creating 3D assets for games and eventually started programming my own game prototypes with Unreal Engine's visual scripting system (blueprints). As I learned more about object oriented programming I realized that I really enjoyed the creative problem solving that came with programming which eventually put me on the path that I'm on now. I believe my aptitude for art, design, creative thinking and my love for tech can ultimately come together to create appealing and engaging web content for everyone. My supervisors and coworkers have praised my diligence as a worker as well as my interpersonal skills which make me a strong addition to any team. Inclusivity, equity, and progressive ideals are incredibly important to me and I want to work with other people who share those values.",

It iterates through a .json file and displays a horned beast component and they can even be filtered down based on how many horns they have! You can also click on them to display a Modal component for even more information. This was equally as challenging as it was rewarding.",
